The answers are given as a flattened matrices


when you do the derivative of a matrix with respect to three dimensions, a matrix already has two dimensions. When you take the derivative, you've got this now this extra dimension with X, Y, and Z

There are some matrices where the Gamma matrix is a number of atoms times the number of atoms matrix. The derivative of the Gamma matrix is given as a three by number of atoms squared object. You just flatten the elements in the matrix so that they're all in a row. It's just, unfortunately, easier to do that than it is to work with three D tensors in C plus plus ring through tensors. 


6 N2 atoms gives error bounds 
 This again, also gives some advice about error checking, it gives upper bounds on number of non zeros. If you're doing these calculations and you're violating, you're getting answers that violate the expected descriptions, then you're definitely doing it incorrectly.


Just suggesting that if you were to create a test case where you shift everything, there should be no change in the forces. If that's not the case, then you have made a mistake somewhere. But it would be pretty hard to get the correct answer and also fail this criteria.
